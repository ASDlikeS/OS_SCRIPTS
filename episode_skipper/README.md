# It's easy GUI, for skipping any episodes on any sites

## Dependencies

**IT's really important for correct using this script, because it works only with chrome**

- ![Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) OR ![Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium/) **Chrome version 114**, Idk why python doesn't have module with newer version
- MICROPHONE (It's main feature of this script, you'll use this script by ure Voice) )

### Usage:

- [Language panel] including Russian and English languages
- [Website URL], here you have to paste url-link from your watching site

For example, I go in Netflix, and go to check out new TV Show, I visit url, that I pasted earlier in GUI, and I try to find button with payload(Next Episode), or (Next) or something else. Ok now I'll paste text inside the button in GUI.
- [Trigger Word] this's trigger word, that will activate, script in Chrome Browser with redirection on next URL
